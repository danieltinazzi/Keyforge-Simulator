# Keyforge-Simulator
Keyforge card game simulator with a sandbox approach and a 2v2 mode.

Install and run:
1. Download the cards with downloader.py written by Tyrox1 [https://github.com/Tyrox1/Keyforge-Downloader]
2. Check if you have all the correct cards (specially for the third expansion which contains anomalies)
3. Put the cards folders (341, 435 and 452) in public/img/cards/
4. $ npm install
5. $ node app.js
6. http://localhost:3000/

Hope you enjoy the game!
